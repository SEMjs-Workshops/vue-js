# Vuetify Lab

## Pre-Lab Setup

1. Start the UI.
   - Run `npm run serve lab-vuetify`
2. In a new terminal, start the test runner.
   - Run `npm run test lab-vuetify`
   - You'll see test failures, which is expected. All of the tests will be passing after you complete this lab.

## Post-Lab Teardown

1. Stop the UI and test processes.
